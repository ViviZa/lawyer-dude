        "text": "When using images from the internet, you can’t avoid talking about copyright. Traditional copyright though is a rather restrictive regime which gives copyright holders exclusive rights (as in “all rights reserved” as a default). Neither copying and distributing nor modifying is permitted without an explicit permission. Only a few use cases get special permissions directly from the law. These so called copyright exceptions are reserved for certain users like teachers in public schools, journalists, judges and so on. Everybody else must rely on explicit permissions from the copyright holders. Unfortunately, this makes traditional copyright not quite compatible with the digital age. <br><br> In this way open licensing (or free licensing) is particularly important in a digital context. Open licensing is meant to make granting permissions easier, which in turn makes reusing content like images easier: Open content is “pre-permitted-to-use content”. This enables others to use this content like images and hand it over to others. Thereby it is a way for creators and rights holders to spread their work more easily - by allowing others to use, share and mix their work without needing to ask for (added individual) permission in advance. By the help of open license models, rights holders determine how their work may be used (“some rights reserved” instead of the default “all rights reserved”). More on this later. <br><br> Unless otherwise stated, the “all rights reserved” rule usually applies: As mentioned before, you are not allowed to use others people’s works without asking for permission. Use in this context is anything beyond consumption of the impression which means anything beyond looking at images, listening to music and so on. So if the rights holder did not give you the explicit right to use, publish or modify the image you have no right to do so. You can imagine that this could be difficult for you if you want to use an image online. A quick use of the work is usually not possible this way. <br><br> By contrast, there is the open content licensing model invented by Creative Commons, the so called CC licenses. If someone publishes her or his own work under such a license, this means that only <b>“some rights are reserved”</b>. Through the use of CC licenses, millions of people have made their photos, videos and other creative content globally available for everyone to use. You can use freely licensed images as long as you follow some basic rules that are defined in the license conditions. One condition all CC licenses have in common is <i>attribution</i>. It aims to ensure that right holders to get the credit for their work they deserve. Just like you, the next time you publish your own image! <br><br> In addition, Creative Commons also provides a tool that allows rights holders to waive all rights and place a work in the public domain (<b>“all rights granted”</b>).",

It is a rapidly growing media file repository of common and freely licensed media content – in the form of images, audio and video files – to which anyone can contribute. The collection is compiled, prepared and made available jointly by volunteers and cultural institutions. <br><br> Unlike traditional media repositories, Wikimedia Commons is <i>free</i>. Everyone is allowed to copy, use and modify any files here freely as long as they follow the terms specified by the author; this often means crediting the source and author(s) appropriately and releasing copies/improvements under the same freedom to others. The license conditions of each individual media file can be found on their description page. <br><br> The material in the repository is sorted into categories and presented in galleries – in fact, working with Wikimedia Commons is incredibly simple. Three categories of the media archive are particularly good examples of the outstanding quality of the collection and the high standards of its contributors: “Featured Pictures”, “Quality Images” and “Valued Images”. <br><br> <b>Search and find</b> <br> Here’s how to find files in Wikimedia Commons really quickly: <br><br> From Wikipedia, for example, you can get to the image integrated in an article quickly and simply by clicking on it (or on the file name for audio or video elements). A click on the link “description page there” then takes you to the media database. Another option is a direct keyword search on: commons.wikimedia.org. Or get inspired by clicking through the media archive’s category system! And if you get lost, you can still take the way through CC-Search and look through the results. <br><br> <b>Copyright and use</b> <br> All files on Wikimedia Commons must either be in the public domain or under a free license. Most pictures in Wikimedia Commons are licensed under a <b>CC BY-SA license</b>, that ensures that free licensed images also stay free in the future. <br> In this license the copyright holder of a work has to be named (BY) and the file must be shared on the same terms (SA = share alike), also when it’s edited. <br> To meet the standards of the Wikimedia projects it is important in all cases to indicate the copyright holder and the license on the respective image description page of the medium. <br> <br> If you want, you can easily find great images on Wikimedia Commons. The media files on Wikimedia Commons were shared by thousands of volunteers or even governmental institutions that decided to provide their data to the platform. Right now there are almost 40,000 active users on the platform. It would be great if maybe you would also decide one day to contribute to Wikimedia Commons too to make knowledge even more accessible! <br> <br> <b>General Disclaimer:</b> <br> Please be advised that nothing found in simple online searches has necessarily been reviewed by professionals with the expertise necessary to provide you with complete, accurate or reliable information. <br> <br> That's not to say that you won't find valuable and accurate information at the <i>Wikimedia Commons</i>, however please be advised that <b><i>Wikimedia Commons</i> as a community project cannot guarantee, in any way whatsoever, the validity of the information found here.</b> However, the volunteers are very attentive to copyright rules and have a very close eye on the content of their platform.

So rather use another image or contact the author and ask for permission to use it.</li> <li><i>Some rights reserved</i> <br> By the help of open license models like the CC licenses, rights holders determine how their work may be used. You can use freely licensed images without asking for permission as long as you follow the conditions defined in the license. </li><li><i>All rights granted</i> <br> Jackpot!
