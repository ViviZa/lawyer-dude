Copyright though is a rather restrictive regime which gives authors exclusive rights (as in “all rights reserved” as a default). Neither copying and distributing nor modifying is permitted without an explicit permission. Unfortunately, this makes traditional copyright not quite compatible with the digital age. <br><br> In this way <b>open licensing</b> (or free licensing) is particularly important in a digital context. Open licensing is meant to make granting permissions easier, which in turn makes reusing content like images easier: Open content is “pre-permitted-to-use content”. This enables others to use this content like images and hand it over to others. Thereby it is a way for authors to spread their work more easily - by allowing others to use, share and mix their work without needing to ask for (added individual) permission in advance. By the help of open license models, authors determine how their work may be used (“some rights reserved” instead of the default “all rights reserved”). More on this later.",

So if the author did not give you the explicit right to use, publish or modify the image you have no right to do so.

You can use freely licensed images as long as you follow some basic rules that are defined in the license conditions. One condition all CC licenses have in common is <b>attribution</b>. It aims to ensure that authors get the credit for their work they deserve.

The license conditions of each individual media file can be found on their description page on Wikimedia Commons. <br><br>The material in the repository is <b>sorted into categories</b> and presented in galleries – in fact, working with Wikimedia Commons is incredibly simple.

        "text": "Actually, it's quite simple! Just ask yourself the following questions before you use an image from the Internet: <br> <b>Who is the author of the image?</b> <br> Do not use images from the internet that come without any copyright information. Because if it is not a freely licensed image, you need the permission of the author to use the image. The only exception is that the rules the image was published under do not require attribution at all (see the public domain waiver “CC0”). <br><br> <b>How may I use the image?</b> <br> Remember, there are four different options: <br><br> <ul> <li><i>All rights reserved</i> <br> Copyright prohibits any use of the image without the author’s permission. So rather use another image or contact the author and ask for permission to use it.</li> <li><i>Some rights reserved</i> <br> By the help of open license models like the CC licenses, authors determine how their work may be used. You can use freely licensed images without asking for permission as long as you follow the conditions defined in the license. </li><li><i>All rights granted</i> <br> Jackpot! The author of the image waived all rights and placed it in the public domain. You are allowed to use the image without any restrictions or obligations. </li><li><i>No information</i> <br> If you cannot find any copyright information using the image without permission is very certainly not permitted. </li></ul> <br><br> <b>What information do I have to provide if I want to use an image?</b> <br>  This depends on your specific use case. A so-called <b>license notice</b> generally consists of <br> <ul> <li> the <i>title</i> of the image (if there is one), <li>the name of the <i>author</i>,</li><li>the <i>source</i> of the image,</li><li>and the link to the <i>license</i>.</li></ul> <br><br> See, it's actually not that difficult. Just follow these simple rules and we'll never see each other in this place again. In case of doubt simply start a new search and select a freely licensed image that contains all necessary information for a correct license notice.",
